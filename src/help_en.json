Together, every 5th day, these satellites will provide us with high-resolution optical images of all land areas ... or of clouds above them. Despite these clouds, users should be guaranteed access to cloud-free data at least once per month. The VenÂµs satellite is expected to become operational just before Sentinel-2, and will observe a hundred sites every 2 days for more than two years. Finally, in the framework of the preparation of these projects, CNES decided to launch the SPOT4 (Take 5) experiment to simulate the repetitivity of Sentinel-2 satellite, using SPOT4, from February to end of may 2013.</p>",
